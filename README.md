# Student Social Media Addiction Analysis
**Overview**
  
This analysis investigates whether users of different social media platforms exhibit significantly different addiction scores, while controlling for demographic and behavioral factors.

**Model**

I use multiple linear regression model to assess the relationship between social media platform usage and addiction score, controlling for variables including age, gender, academic level, sleep hours, average daily usage, and relationship status.
* **Adjusted R²:** 0.810 — The model explains **81%** of the variance in addiction scores.
* **F-statistic:** 159.2, p < 0.001 — The model is **statistically significant** overall.
  
**Key Findings**
  
* TikTok (+0.86), Snapchat (+0.81), and Instagram (+0.53) users have significantly higher addiction scores compared to other platforms.
* LINE (−1.35), Twitter (−0.40), VKontakte (−0.43), and WhatsApp (−0.28) users show significantly lower addiction scores.
* YouTube (+0.49) is also associated with a higher score, although the effect size is smaller.
